UPDATES

<2022 v3.0u>
1. The game now is in widescreen, has window auto-centering and maintains aspect ratio when maximized (optimized mainly for 1920x1080 resolution and Windows 11).

2. Game loading is really fast now.

3. When using the function keys, the HP/Dark HP/MP numbers are displayed under the playerâ€™s HP bar (1 - Current HP, 2 - Maximal available HP to be recovered, 3 - Current MP).

4. New icon, fixes and changes to design and UI (both visually and text), and overall "Quality of Life" approach in mind.

5. Input is more responsive now (single-player gaming).

6. Correction changes of statistics (attack, kill etc) count were made.

7. "Ratio+1" and "Spectator" characters were added:
- ratio is useful for making Stage Mode harder without adding bots to your team;
- spectator is useful for spectating custom game with other players or bots (without them attacking you), you can also dissappear from map completely by pressing "attack" button.

8. Optional Addons and Mods are available now ("_Addons" and "_Mods" folders).

9. Instructions section is now added ("_Instructions" folder).

10. Movelist and Controls have been replaced by visual guide program ("Guide & Movelist" folder).
