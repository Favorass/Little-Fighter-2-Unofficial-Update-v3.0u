## Updates

### <2022 v3.0u>

1. The game now is in **widescreen**, has **window auto-centering** and **maintains aspect ratio** when maximized (optimized mainly for **1920x1080** resolution and **Windows 11**).

2. Game **loading** is **really fast** now.

3. When using the function keys, the HP/Dark HP/MP numbers are displayed under the player’s HP bar (1 - Current HP, 2 - Maximal available HP to be recovered, 3 - Current MP).

4. New icon, fixes and changes to **design** and **UI** (both visually and text), and overall **"Quality of Life"** approach in mind.

5. **Input** is **more responsive** now (single-player gaming).

6. Correction changes of statistics (attack, kill etc) count were made.

7. **"Ratio+1"** and **"Spectator"** characters were added:
- **ratio** is useful for making Stage Mode harder without adding bots to your team;
- **spectator** is useful for spectating custom game with other players or bots (without them attacking you), you can also dissappear from map completely by pressing "attack" button.

8. Optional **Addons** and **Mods** are available now (**"_Addons"** and **"_Mods" folders**).

9. **Instructions** section is now added (**"_Instructions" folder**).

10. **Movelist** and **Controls** have been replaced by **visual guide program** (**"Guide & Movelist" folder**).
