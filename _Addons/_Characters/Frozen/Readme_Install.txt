Frozen
------
Based on Steam's sketch, this is Siegvar's take on the character. In addition to a simple but aesthetically pleasing set of ice based skills, Frozen possesses a specialised set of counters and evasive skills that has the flair and substance to live up to his namesake. This set of counters and evasive skills are not easy to use, and Frozen can survive without them. However, if these skills are mastered, they make Frozen an incredibly tenacious fighter.
