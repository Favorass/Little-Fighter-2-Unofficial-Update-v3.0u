===MOVELIST===

Gad is a powerful bruiser, his wild animal fury and imposing physique make him a deadly force to behold!
He has great reach, strong anti-air capabilities and is a bit faster than normal on the x-axis.
However, he is a bit slow on the z-axis, has quite a long recovery time and his large body presents a bigger target.

PASSIVE PERKS:
	Sharp Claws	=	All of Gad's attacks can hit multiple enemies, INCLUDING during grab!
	Alligator Spin	=	Gad can spin & throw heavy weapons.	[60mp / 12% per spin]
	Crocodile Roll	=	Gad can roll along z-axis slightly, and from Super_punch & DvA Shrafe.
	Grab Direction	=	Gad can change the direction he is grabbing his enemy.
	Drink Reflex	=	Gad can cancel drinking with either D or J.
note: you cannot change direction while spinthrowing heavy weapons if F6 is enabled.

BASIC ATTACKS:
1.	Punch			-	quite similar to Dennis, but recovers a bit faster & moves forward a lot more.
2.	Run Attack		-	blocks attacks initially, then charge forward to claw. Can move along z-axis. Good for killing bandits.
3.	Jump Attack		-	a simple but powerful kick. Can be used twice on a jumping enemy.
4.	Dash Claw		-	a quick dash attack with a bit more forward movement & height than regular, and shorter itr duration.

SPECIAL MOVES
==============

1.	Energy Slashes				D>A		[125mp / 25%]
Does two short-range blasts similar to Deep's, but with Woody's attack style.

2.	Reptilian Shrafe			DvA		[75mp / 15%]
Unleash a flurry of attacks similar to Davis. It ends with an upward jump kick, and you can roll/dash away upon landing.

3.	Javelin Spin				D>J		[200mp / 40%]
Lunge forward with incredible force, similar to Woody's tiger dash.
	* Can be used while rolling.

4.	Alligator Charge			D^J		[125mp / 25% (+continuous mp cost)]
Charge forward and attempt to grab the enemy. When successful, hold the enemy infront of you like a battering ram.
	* Can be used while rolling.
	* Pressing >A or J allows you to Spin Throw. Keep pressing A/J to keep spinning. You may change direction while spinning.
	* Unlike the heavy_weapon version, F6 does not affect the direction change.

==============

COMBOS:
1)	Claw Combo		AA Grab A*5 DvA >JA		(> must be hit just after landing from shrafe to enter instant run)
2)	Kick DashClaw	AA Super >>JA			(enemy must be somewhere behind Gad, and facing Gad's back)
3)	Shrafe DashClaw	DvA >>JA				(enemy must be somewhere behind Gad, or be pushed into a wall)
4)	Shrafe Javelin	DvA D>J					(enemy should be somewhere inside or in front of Gad)
5)	Shrafe Grab		DvA D...^J				(tap D just as you land on the ground, then ^J. Don't bother buffering D^J unless near a wall; it won't work unless you roll first)
6)	Slash Javelin	D>A J					(its actually D>A D>J, but the controls are like this due to a bug with LF2's input detection itself)
7)	Slash DashClaw	> D>A >JA				(D>A must be all 3 buttons at once to allow instant run to work)
WALL COMBOS:
1)	Shrafe JumpAtk			DvA >J A			(jump attack)
2)	GrabThrow DashClaw		> Grab >A >JA		(dash atack)
3)	Gadian Death Roll		AA DvA D>A D^J		(very hard to do; both D>A balls must hit for this to work)
4)	Reptilian Frenzy		AA DvA D>A (D>)J	(very hard to do; both D>A balls must hit for this to work)

Known Bugs / "Features":
* weapon disappear if rolling into edge of map, or if D>J with back towards wall. Nothing much I can do about this and even normal LF2 characters are affected by this.
