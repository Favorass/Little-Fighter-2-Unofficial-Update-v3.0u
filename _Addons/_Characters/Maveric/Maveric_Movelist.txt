Moves
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Laser (D>A +A+A+...)
   This is a laser that can be fired multiple times. Although it does
   home for the next opponent you can still aim by holding up or down
   while shooting. It can also be performed while jumping.

- Skip Lock (D^J/DvJ)
   This move allows you to skip right to the next enemy within range.
   The range is limited to an area in front of Maveric, however it
   can be drastically expanded when using it next to a teammate.
   When there is no character in this range it can be used to dodge
   attacks by holding the up or down button. This way you can also
   extend it's range on the z-axis.

- Skip Slash (D>J +J/D>J)
   This is a fast slashing combo that can be easily added to a skip
   Lock by pressing J. The second slash can be performed either fast
   with another D>J or slow with J. The fast option allows you to
   change the direction of your move.

- Gravitation Halo (DvA +A)
   Inducing this charge takes mana and health, while charging your
   health will regenerate again and objects around you will be
   sucked towards you. Once you run out of mana or press A the
   charge will be released in a big energy halo.

Advanced controls
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following paragraphs will focus on Maverics basic attack system,
 his enforced moves, other inputs and a few connective combinations.

 Maverics more powerful basic attacks (super-, run-, dash-) are energy
 powered moves that might empty out your mana bar pretty fast, but you
 will use non-energy powered moves instead if you don't have enough
 mana. You can use the non-energy powered dash-attack even with high
 mana when you press JA at once while running instead of J+A.

 You might have noticed the energy spark once Maveric blocked an
 attack. His Energy Managing Device (EMD), the glove, allows him to
 use the defended energy to induce more powerful moves, counter the
 attack or heal himself.
 Actions upon successfully defending an attack:
- Energy Discharge (+A)
   Send the energy back where it came from. Recommended for blocked
   melee attacks.
- Heal (+J)
   Heal yourself. Recommended for blocked projectile attacks.
- Funnel Spreader (+D>A)
   Release several homing lasers that scatter once they hit.
   Recommended for distant enemy groups.
- Skip Chain (+D^J/DvJ)
   Chain up to five skip attacks together. Recommended for close
   enemy groups. Will fail with teammates around.
- Skip Combo (+D>J)
   Unleash five fast slash attacks. Recommended for one on one fights.
- Gravitational Overload (+DvA)
   Charge up more energy than your EMD could possibly take in.
   This one might not turn out to your advantage. Use with caution.

 Other inputs:
- Skip (JA)
   This is similar to the Skip Lock, but it will not lock onto other
   characters. Since it takes less mana to perform it is the better
   move to simply dodge projectiles or set up a fast Skip Slash.
- Running Skip (>> DA)
   This special skip can be used to unexpectedly rush towards your
   opponent and take him down with a run-attack.
- Uppercut (D^A)
   This is Maverics energy powered super-attack set to a key
   combination, similar to Woodys flip-kick.
- Energy Discharge (G+D>A)
   Blow your opponent away instead of throwing him.
- Converter (G+J +J+J+...)
   Convert your opponents health into mana for yourself.

 Connectives:
  >> DA +J/D>J +J/D>J
  JA +J/D>J +J/D>J
  DvJ/D^J +J/D>J +J/D>J
  D^A +D>J
  D^A +J +A
  D^A +D +A
  ...

Overdrive
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The new overdrive mode allows Maveric to charge all his ground based
 energy moves over the safety limit. The two energy driven punches
 simply become a little stronger and overcharging the special moves
 will make him perform their counter version.
 However be cautious with this feature, it can kill you.

 To overdrive your EMD just press and hold backwards as you perform
 a move (opposite direction you are facing). Release the key to start
 the overdrive attack.
